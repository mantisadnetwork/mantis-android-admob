====================

Mediation layer that can be plugged into an AdMob implementation to serve advertisements from the MANTIS Ad Network on an Android application.



# Configuring AdMob

After updating your application to include the MANTIS mediation library, you must now configure mediation per ad unit in the AdMob interface. Here is a breakdown of each setup if creating an ad unit from scratch.

## Create the ad unit

The AdMob "ad unit" is the equivelant of a "zone" on the MANTIS platform. For each ad unit you configure, you should already have a zone configured through the MANTIS administration panel.
